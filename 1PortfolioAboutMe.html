            <h1>About Work Experience</h1>
            <span>On <span id="highlightT"> January 21st 2026</span>, students from Year 10 in Cranford Community College are informed to enroll in a company for a <span id="highlightT"> one day work experience.</span> </span>
            <span>Students are told to contact a company which is in an industry you aspire to work in.</span>
            <span>In work experience I look forward to:</span>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Observe and Learn</b> from workers in the job role I aspire to be in.</li>
                <li><b>Gain Insights</b> to see how workers perform their day-to-day tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Perform Tasks</b> to test my prior knowledge and to show my potential in the industry.</li>

            <h1>My School Accomplishments</h1>

            <p>Throughout my school years I have accomplished many things across all of my core subjects. So far in Year 10 I have had no formal examinations although here are some results from the past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maths, English Science: In the 3 core subjects I achieve exceptionally high marks, on the grading scale 9-1, I mainly get grades 8/9. </li>
                <li>Computer Science: Due to my prior knowledge in computer science and programming, I find computer science extremely easy, I get grade 9. </li>
                <li>Despite my great knowledge in the main subjects, I believe in consistency, therefore I work towards grades 8/9 in my other subjects such as: Religious Studies and Spanish. In RS, I confidently get grade 9's across every test I do. In Spanish, I can comfortably form conversations.</li>
                <li>In Geography, I establish strong arguments to a solid grade 9 level.</li>
            </ul>


        </div>

        <div id="Aspire">

            <h1>What do I aspire to do in the future?</h1>

            <p>My passion for the IT industry is supported by my academic capabilities. I have a strong foundation in logical thinking which can be proven in my maths and sciences skills. In English, I have a creative mindset which complements my programming projects such as this one. I tend to look at things with different perspectives from everyone's point of view, this skill would be valuable in website design.</p>
            <p>In my freetime, I tend to research about job roles in the IT industry, the one which has piqued me the most is full-stack web development. This includes both the front and back-end of the website. I aspire to work in both specialisations and then concluding them by being a full-stack developer.</p>
            <p>I am also looking forward to learning AI and Machine Learning to enhance my website projects.</p>
            <p>For A-Levels, I plan on choosing: Computer Science, Further Maths and Physics</p>
